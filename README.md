I provide support to graduate students for the course Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) at Carnegie Mellon University Africa in Kigali, Rwanda. This class includes administering and grading of assignments, conducting guided student labs and development of class quizzes. The IDS class introduces students to fascinating mathematical fields such as Probability theory, Statistics and Detection Theory which are all underlying components of intrusion detection systems (IDS). 

A good understanding of this prepares these future security practitioners to better appreciate the benefits and limitations of IDS as well as prepare them to become better practitioners. The class also takes a deep dive into intrusion detection (host and network-based IDSs, techniques of intrusion detectionâ€”anomaly, behavioral and signature-based), a brief review of the mathematical background of IDSs, and case studies of mathematical solutions for IDSs and the issues related to their applications in the real-world.
